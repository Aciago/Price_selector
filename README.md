 bot for scraping ammo data and finding best deals

Problem:
Huge number of online shops offer various types of .22 LR ammunition. Some give discounts on large orders, some offer free shipping, some offer low prices but no discounts. I would like to automate the process of finding best deals.

Plan:
1) Scrape data from various sources
2) Collect data in one place, converting into a complete price breakdown (ammo itself, shipping, discounts, etc).
3) Return a result in a form of specific offer to buy from (shop, link, ammo, price, etc)
